A brief description of your MVP
Users (survey creators) are allowed to create surveys they can share by URL with other users (survey takers). Survey takers' answers are recorded in a database so that after a survey is taken, the taker will see all-time stats (e.g., what percentage of users chose a certain answer). Survey creators can login and see stats for the surveys they created.

A brief description of your team dynamic and git workflow.
We started on Fri, Dec 19 by spending an hour poking around on surveymonkey.com and building wireframes representing the stripped down, bare functionality of the site that we want to replicate. After lunch we spent at least 3 hours together as a team designing the backend and writing out a roadmap in a notes file that would determine the tasks to be accomplished. To start, we split the two core flows/features (survey creation and survey taking) and assigned them to two pairs. We then setup a Trello board to break down the individual tasks and assign them to individuals. This will allow us to stay focused on specific tasks at hand and allow us to drop more cards into Trello if we decide more functionality is needed and when issues/bugs arise.
